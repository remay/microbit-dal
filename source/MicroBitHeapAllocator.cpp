#include "MicroBit.h"

/**
  * A simple 32 bit block based memory allocator. This allows one or more memory segments to
  * be designated as heap storage, and is designed to run in a static memory area or inside the standard C
  * heap for use by the micro:bit runtime. This is required for several reasons:
  *
  * 1) It reduces memory fragmentation due to the high churn sometime placed on the heap 
  * by ManagedTypes, fibers and user code. Underlying heap implentations are often have very simplistic
  * allocation pilicies and suffer from fragmentation in prolonged use - which can cause programs to
  * stop working after a period of time. The algorithm implemented here is simple, but highly tolerant to 
  * large amounts of churn. 
  *
  * 2) It allows us to reuse the 8K of SRAM set aside for SoftDevice as additional heap storage
  * when BLE is not in use.
  *
  * 3) It gives a simple example of how memory allocation works! :-)
  *
  * N.B. The need for this should be reviewed in the future, should a different memory allocator be
  * made availiable in the mbed platform.
  *
  * P.S. This is a very simple allocator, therefore not without its weaknesses. Why don't you consider 
  * what these are, and consider the tradeoffs against simplicity...
  *
  * TODO: Consider caching recently freed blocks to improve allocation time.
